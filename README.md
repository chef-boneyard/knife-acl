# knife-acl

## Description

This is a Chef Software, Inc.-supported knife plugin which provides some user/group
ACL operations for Chef server.

All commands assume a working knife configuration for an admin user of a Chef organization.

### Installation

Install into [Chef DK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/).

    chef gem install knife-acl

### _Warning about Users group_

The "Users" group is a special group and should not be managed with knife-acl.
As such, knife-acl will give an error if either `knife acl group add user users USER`
or `knife acl group remove user users USER` are run.

### Chef Server Roles Based Access Control (RBAC) Summary

In the context of the Chef Server's API a container is just the API endpoint used
when creating a new object of a particular object type.

For example, the container for creating client objects is called `clients` and
the container for creating node objects is called `nodes`.

Two containers are used when creating (uploading) cookbooks.
The `cookbooks` and `sandboxes` containers.

Here is a full list of the containers in a Chef Server.

- clients
- cookbooks
- data
- environments
- groups
- nodes
- policies
- policy_groups
- roles
- sandboxes

The permissions assigned to a container are inherited by the objects
that the container creates. When a permission is changed on a container
that change will only affect new objects. The change does not propagate to
existing objects.

For reference and restoral purposes the
[Default Permissions for Containers](#default-permissions-for-containers) section
of this document contains `knife-acl` commands that will set the default
permissions for the admins, clients and users groups on all containers.
These can be helpful if you need to restore container permissions back to their
default values.

#### Permissions Management Best Practice

The best practice for managing permissions is to only add clients and groups to an objects' permissions.

Adding a user to an objects' permissions is possible by first adding the group to the permissions and
then adding the user to the group. This is much easier to maintain when compared to adding
individual users to each objects' permissions.

To enforce this the `knife acl add` and `knife acl bulk add` commands can only add a client or a group
to an objects' permissions.

If a group ever needs to be removed from the permissions of all objects the group can simply
be deleted.

## Example use cases

The following documents show the `knife acl` commands to address some commmon use cases:

* [Setup default read-only access for non-admin users](./use_cases/default_readonly_for_admins.md)
* [Create a new read-only group](./use_cases/create_readonly_group.md)
* [Reset ChefServer to default permission setup](./use_cases/default_server_permissions.md)
* [Enable nodes/client to update data bags](./use_cases/databags.md)

# Subcommands

## knife user list

Show a list of users associated with your organization

## knife group list

List groups in the organization.

## knife group create GROUP_NAME

Create a new group `GROUP_NAME` to the organization.

## knife group show GROUP_NAME

Show the membership details for `GROUP_NAME`.

## knife group add MEMBER_TYPE MEMBER_NAME GROUP_NAME

Add MEMBER_NAME to `GROUP_NAME`.

Valid `MEMBER_TYPE` values are

- client
- group
- user

## knife group remove MEMBER_TYPE MEMBER_NAME GROUP_NAME

Remove `MEMBER_NAME` from `GROUP_NAME`.

See the `knife group add` documentation above for valid `MEMBER_TYPE` values.

## knife group destroy GROUP_NAME

Removes group `GROUP_NAME` from the organization.  All members of the group
(clients, groups and users) remain in the system, only `GROUP_NAME` is removed.

The `admins`, `billing-admins`, `clients` and `users` groups are special groups
so knife-acl will not allow them to be destroyed.

## knife acl show OBJECT_TYPE OBJECT_NAME

Shows the ACL for the specified object.  Objects are identified by the
combination of their type and name.

Valid `OBJECT_TYPE` values are

- clients
- containers
- cookbooks
- data
- environments
- groups
- nodes
- policies
- policy_groups
- roles

For example, use the following command to obtain the ACL for a node
named "web.example.com":

    knife acl show nodes web.example.com

## knife acl add MEMBER_TYPE MEMBER_NAME OBJECT_TYPE OBJECT_NAME PERMS

The best practice is to only add clients and groups to ACLs. To enforce this best practice
the `knife acl add` command is only able to add a client or a group to ACLs.

Valid `MEMBER_TYPE` values are

- client
- group

Add `MEMBER_NAME` to the `PERMS` access control entry of `OBJECT_NAME`.
Objects are specified by the combination of their type and name.

Valid `OBJECT_TYPE` values are

- clients
- containers
- cookbooks
- data
- environments
- groups
- nodes
- policies
- policy_groups
- roles

Valid `PERMS` are:

- create
- read
- update
- delete
- grant

Multiple `PERMS` can be given in a single command by separating them
with a comma with no extra spaces.

For example, use the following command to give the superusers group
the ability to delete and update the node called "web.example.com":

    knife acl add group superusers nodes web.example.com delete,update

## knife acl bulk add MEMBER_TYPE MEMBER_NAME OBJECT_TYPE REGEX PERMS

The best practice is to only add clients and groups to ACLs. To enforce this best practice
the `knife acl bulk add` command is only able to add a client or a group to ACLs.

Valid `MEMBER_TYPE` values are

- client
- group

Add `MEMBER_NAME` to the `PERMS` access control entry for each object in a
set of objects of `OBJECT_TYPE`.

The set of objects are specified by matching the objects' names with the
given REGEX regular expression surrounded by quotes.

See the `knife acl add` documentation above for valid `OBJECT_TYPE` and `PERMS` values.

Appending `-y` or `--yes` to the `knife acl bulk add` command will run the command
without any prompts for confirmation.

For example, use the following command to give the superusers group the ability to
delete and update all nodes matching the regular expression 'WIN-.*':

    knife acl bulk add group superusers nodes 'WIN-.*' delete,update --yes

## knife acl remove MEMBER_TYPE MEMBER_NAME OBJECT_TYPE OBJECT_NAME PERMS

Remove `MEMBER_NAME` from the `PERMS` access control entry of `OBJECT_NAME`.
Objects are specified by the combination of their type and name.

Valid `MEMBER_TYPE` values are

- client
- group
- user

Valid `OBJECT_TYPE` values are

- clients
- containers
- cookbooks
- data
- environments
- groups
- nodes
- policies
- policy_groups
- roles

Valid `PERMS` are:

- create
- read
- update
- delete
- grant

Multiple `PERMS` can be given in a single command by separating them
with a comma with no extra spaces.

For example, use the following command to remove the superusers group from the delete and
update access control entries for the node called "web.example.com":

    knife acl remove group superusers nodes web.example.com delete,update

## knife acl bulk remove MEMBER_TYPE MEMBER_NAME OBJECT_TYPE REGEX PERMS

Remove `MEMBER_NAME` from the `PERMS` access control entry for each object in a
set of objects of `OBJECT_TYPE`.

The set of objects are specified by matching the objects' names with the
given REGEX regular expression surrounded by quotes.

See the `knife acl remove` documentation above for valid `MEMBER_TYPE`, `OBJECT_TYPE` and `PERMS` values.

Appending `-y` or `--yes` to the `knife acl bulk add` command will run the command
without any prompts for confirmation.

For example, use the following command to remove the superusers group from the delete and
update access control entries for all nodes matching the regular expression 'WIN-.*':

    knife acl bulk remove group superusers nodes 'WIN-.*' delete,update --yes
