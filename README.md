# knife-acl

# Description

This is a Chef Software, Inc.-supported knife plugin which provides some user/group
ACL operations for Chef server. All commands assume a working knife
configuration for an organization on a Chef server.

# User Specific Association Groups

User Specific Association Groups (USAGs) are a mechanism to grant access to
organization objects to users such that it is possible to quickly revoke the
access without touching all objects in the organization.

Each USAG contains a single user. The USAG is then added to other groups or
directly to the ACLs of an object as needed.

When the user is dissociated from an organization only the user's USAG needs to
be deleted thereby quickly revoking access to all objects in the organization.

USAGs and their membership within other normal groups are not visible in the
[management console's web interface](https://manage.chef.io).

## STOP managing group membership with the web interface

USAGs are currently the correct way to add/remove users to/from groups in an
organization.

**Be warned**, once you start managing a group's membership using `knife-acl`
you should **avoid managing that group's membership using the [management
console's web interface](https://manage.chef.io)**.

You can add USAGs to a group using `knife-acl` but if you click "Save Group" in
the web interface then all USAGs will be removed from the group erasing any
`knife-acl` work that was done on the group. This will happen even if no
changes were made to the group's members in the web interface.

The "users" group is a special group. When a user is associated with an
organization the user's USAG is automatically made a member of the
"users" group. You can remove USAGs from the "users" group using `knife-acl`
but if you click "Save Group" in the web interface then all USAGs in the
organization will be added back to the "users" group erasing any `knife-acl`
work that was done on the "users" group. This will happen even if no changes
were made to the group's members in the web interface.

# Example: Manage a read-only Group

You can use these commands to manage a read-only group.  To do so:

1. Run `knife actor map` to create/update a local actor map file
   `actor-map.yaml`:

        knife actor map

2. Create a group that will hold read-only users:

        knife group create read-only

3. For each user you wish to have read only access as defined by
   permissions given to the "read-only" group do the following:

        knife group add actor read-only USER
        knife group remove actor users USER

   This adds the user to the "read-only" group and removes them from the
   "users" group which has more permissions by default (users are
   added to "users" when added to an organizaton).

# Installation

This knife plugin is packaged as a gem.  To install it, enter the
following:

## With [Chef DK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)

    chef gem install knife-acl

## On the shell of a Chef server active backend

As root:

    /opt/opscode/embedded/bin/gem install knife-acl

## With chef-client installed from a RubyGems

    gem install knife-acl

# Subcommands

## knife user list

Show a list of users associated with your organization

## knife actor map

Create a local map file named "actor-map.yaml" that maps users to their USAG
and stores a list of clients.

This command creates a local cache of the user to USAG mapping as well
as a local cache of clients and is used by the following commands:

- `knife group show`
- `knife group add actor`
- `knife group remove actor`

## knife group create

Create a new group.

## knife group list

List groups in the organization.

## knife group show GROUP

Show the details membership details for `GROUP`. If you have run
`knife actor map`, the user map file will be used to annotate USAGs so
you can see what user they represent.

## knife group add actor GROUP ACTOR

Add ACTOR to GROUP.  ACTOR can be a user name or a client
name. Requires an up-to-date actor map as created by `knife actor
map`.  The user's USAG will be added as a subgroup of GROUP if ACTOR
is a user.

## knife group remove actor GROUP ACTOR

Remove ACTOR from GROUP. Requires an up-to-date actor map as created by
`knife actor map`.  The user's USAG will be removed from the subgroups
of GROUP if ACTOR is a user.

## knife group destroy GROUP

Removes `GROUP` from the organization.  All members of the group (both
actors and groups) remain in the system, only `GROUP` is removed.

## knife acl show OBJECT_TYPE OBJECT_NAME

Shows the ACL for the specified object.  Objects are identified by the
combination of their type and name.

Valid `OBJECT_TYPE`s are

- clients
- containers
- cookbooks
- data
- environments
- groups
- nodes
- roles

For example, use the following command to obtain the ACL for a node
named "web.example.com":

    knife acl show nodes web.example.com

## knife acl add OBJECT_TYPE OBJECT_NAME PERM [group|client] NAME

Add the group or client with NAME to the PERM access control entry of
the object.  Objects are specified by the combination of
their type and name.  See the `knife acl show` documentation above for
the permitted types.

Valid `PERM`s are:

- create
- read
- update
- delete
- grant

For example, use the following command to give the superuser group
the ability to delete the node called "api.example.com":

    knife acl add node api.exmaple.com delete group superusers

## knife acl remove OBJECT_TYPE OBJECT_NAME PERM [group|client] NAME

Remove group or client with NAME from the PERM access control entry of
the specified object.  Objects are specified by the combination of
their type and name.  See the `knife acl show` documentation above for
the permitted types.  See the `knife acl add` documentation above for
the permitted `PERMS`s.

For example, use the following command to remove the superuser group's
ability to delete the node called "api.example.com":

    knife acl remove node api.exmaple.com delete group superusers

## TODO

- Feature: build group membership graph
- Remove duplication in commands
- Staleness detector for actor map
- Improve error messages when actor map is missing
- Don't save group if it will be a no-op
